# 05. Recursion

- Recursion is important to Haskell because unlike imperative languages, you do computations in Haskell by declaring what something *is* instead of declaring *how* you get it.
- the edge case often is the identity (empty list, 0 - addition, 1 - multiplication)
- trees: the edge case is usually a node that doesn't have any children.
